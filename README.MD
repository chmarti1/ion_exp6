This is the sixth in a series of experiments investigating the ion transport physics of the oxyfuel cutting flame.  This experiment studies the change of the flame resistance as the standoff distance changes.

A detailed description of the experimental approach and the results is included in the [2021 ASME Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference paper](./docs/2021msec.pdf) included in the `docs` folder.

In this experiment, an oxyfuel torch was used to cut steel plates while an oscillating current was imposed between the torch and workpiece.  Meanwhile, a water-cooled precision potentiometer measured the actual standoff height between the torch and work piece.  The data files include simultaneous measurements of the flame voltage, current, and the potentometer voltage.

Files are organized into directories
- `./bin`  contains the executable scripts and configuration files.
- `./data`  contains raw data and post-processed data.
- `./docs`  contains dataset documentation
- `./export`  contains plots and data amalgamated from multiple individual data sets.

For more information on the binaries, read the [binary documentation](./docs/bin.md).  For more information on the raw data files, read the [data documentation](./docs/data.md).
